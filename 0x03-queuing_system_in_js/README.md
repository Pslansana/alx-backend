# Queuing System in JavaScript

## Project Overview

In this project, you will learn how to implement a queuing system using Redis and Kue in a Node.js environment. The project will involve setting up Redis, creating a queue system with Kue, and interacting with the Redis server to perform basic operations. You'll also integrate the queue with an Express.js application to manage tasks effectively.

The project will run from Dec 2, 2024, 3:00 AM to Dec 5, 2024, 3:00 AM, and the manual QA review was completed on Dec 14, 2024, at 8:15 AM. This project involves mandatory tasks to complete the setup and implementation successfully.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to confidently explain the following concepts without needing to look up references:

### 1. **How to run a Redis server on your machine**
   - You will learn how to install and run Redis on your local machine. Redis will act as a key-value store and be integral to your queuing system.

### 2. **How to run simple operations with the Redis client**
   - You will explore basic Redis operations like setting and getting keys, which is the foundation of interacting with Redis from your Node.js application.

### 3. **How to use a Redis client with Node.js for basic operations**
   - You will learn how to use a Redis client for Node.js to perform operations such as pushing items to a queue and retrieving them for processing.

### 4. **How to store hash values in Redis**
   - Redis allows you to store hash data structures. You will learn how to use these structures to store complex data like task details in your queuing system.

### 5. **How to deal with async operations with Redis**
   - Since Redis operations are asynchronous, you will learn how to handle async functions properly in Node.js using Promises and async/await to ensure smooth operation.

### 6. **How to use Kue as a queue system**
   - Kue is a simple job queue system built on top of Redis. You will learn how to set up Kue in your application, create jobs, and manage their lifecycle (e.g., processing, completion, failure).

### 7. **How to build a basic Express app interacting with a Redis server**
   - You will learn how to create a basic Express.js application and interact with the Redis server to store and retrieve data for your queue system.

### 8. **How to build a basic Express app interacting with a Redis server and queue**
   - You will build an Express.js application that integrates both Redis and Kue. This application will manage jobs that are added to the queue and processed asynchronously.

## Project Tasks

During this project, you will:

1. Set up a Redis server on your local machine and interact with it using the Redis client for Node.js.
2. Install and configure Kue to manage job queues.
3. Write Node.js code to create and manage jobs within the queue using Kue.
4. Build a basic Express.js app to handle the interaction between the application and Redis server.
5. Implement job processing, allowing tasks to be added, processed, and completed within the queue.
6. Handle error cases and manage the state of jobs in the queue.

## Conclusion

By completing this project, you will gain practical experience in setting up Redis, using Kue for task queuing, and building a basic Express.js app that interacts with Redis and Kue. This project will provide a foundation for managing tasks asynchronously and is an essential skill for building scalable systems that require background job processing.
