# 0x02. i18n

## Project Overview
This project focuses on adding internationalization (i18n) to a Flask application. By using the `Flask-Babel` library, the project enables support for multiple languages, making the application accessible to users in different regions. Additionally, it includes localization of timestamps using `pytz` and implements locale detection based on URL parameters or request headers.

## Learning Objectives
- **Parametrize Flask templates** to serve content in different languages.
- **Detect and infer locale** from URL parameters, user preferences, or request headers.
- **Localize timestamps** using `pytz` for timezone-specific time display.
